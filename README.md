## Description
By using Node JS, this application will automatically generate a README file for any project you are working on.  
## Installation
To begin setting up your development environment, you must first run `npm init` in the terminal, to set up a new npm package.  Once nom has been initialized, you must also run `npm i inquirer` in the terminal to install inquirer, which will install the inquirer and allow the user to ask and validate questions to help generate the README.  
## Usage
After initializing npm and installing Inquirer, the user must run `node index.js` in the terminal.  The user will be prompted with a series of questions that should be answered in relation to your project.  After completing the questions, the README will automatically generate as a new file.
